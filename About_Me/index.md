My name is Michael Culshaw-Maurer. I'm a postdoctoral researcher working with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/) to improve computational and quantitative education for researchers across a wide range of fields. I also help out with [R help sessions](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/schedule) at the University of Arizona, and I serve on the UA [Data Science Research and Training Steering Committee](https://datascience.arizona.edu/steering-committee).

A behavioral ecologist by training, I received my PhD from the Graduate Group in Ecology at UC Davis, advised by [Jay Rosenheim](https://rosenheim.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) and [Sebastian Schreiber](http://www.eve.ucdavis.edu/sschreiber/), and supported by a [USDA NIFA Predoctoral Fellowship](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development). In grad school I was an Affiliate of the UC Davis [Data Lab](http://datascience.ucdavis.edu/), co-coordinator of the [Davis R Users Group](https://d-rug.github.io/), co-founder of the UC Davis Ecological Stats Support Group, and I taught the graduate level [R for Data Analysis and Visualization in Science](https://mcmaurer.github.io/R-DAVIS-3.0/index.html) course. I also served as a Head Steward for the [UC Student Workers Union](http://www.uaw2865.org/).

I'm a hobbyist photographer, which serves as a nice creative outlet after a long day in the lab or office. You can check out some of my galleries on my [photography page](https://mcmaurer.github.io/Photography/). I also enjoy playing racquetball and lacrosse, camping, canoeing, hiking, and thrift shopping.

You can [contact me by email](https://mcmaurer.github.io/Email_Me/) or follow me on Twitter, Github, or Instagram by following the links at the bottom of this page. You can also try carrier pigeon, message in a bottle, or yelling really loud, but these have proven less successful.
