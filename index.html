excerpt: "I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Karnes Lab](https://karneslab.org/) at the [College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona](https://www.pharmacy.arizona.edu/). As a pharmacogenomics lab we are interested in investigating the utility of genetic polymorphisms to predict toxicities of cardiovascular drugs.

<br>

I am a human geneticist by training, and I did my PhD as part of the Genetics Graduate Interdisciplinary Program at the University of Arizona, advised by Christina Laukaitis.
